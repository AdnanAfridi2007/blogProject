## What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created as an extension of the C programming language. It is widely used for system/software development, game development, and in performance-critical applications. C++ supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we start coding, we need to set up our development environment. You can use any IDE like [Visual Studio], [Code::Blocks], or [CLion]. Make sure you have a C++ compiler like [GCC] or [Clang] installed.

## Basic Syntax

C++ syntax is the set of rules that define a correctly structured C++ program. Here are some basic syntax rules:

- Statements end with a semicolon (`;`).
- Comments can be added using `//` for single-line or `/* */` for multi-line comments.
- Code blocks are defined using curly braces `{}`.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data values. In C++, you can declare a variable using data types like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc. Here are some examples:

```cpp showLineNumbers
int age = 30;
float salary = 50000.50;
char grade = 'A';
bool isStudent = true;
```

## For Printing 
```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age = 30;
    float salary = 50000.50;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool isStudent = true;

    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Age: " << age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Salary: " << salary << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Grade: " << grade << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is Student: " << std::boolalpha << isStudent << std::endl;
```


## For loop example
```cpp showLineNumbers
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl; 
    return 0;
```
