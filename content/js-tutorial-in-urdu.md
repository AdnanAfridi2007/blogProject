## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside [HTML] and [CSS].

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we start coding, we need to set up our development environment. You can use any text editor like [Visual Studio Code], [Sublime Text], or even Notepad++. Make sure you have a modern web browser like [Google Chrome] or [Firefox].

## Basic Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program. Here are some basic syntax rules:

- Statements end with a semicolon (`;`).
- Comments can be added using `//` for single-line or `/* */` for multi-line comments.
- Code blocks are defined using curly braces `{}`.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Here are some examples:

```javascript showLineNumbers
let age = 30;
let salary = 50000.50;
let grade = 'A';
let isStudent = true;
```

## For Printing

```javascript showLineNumbers {3}
console.log("Hello, World!");
console.log("Age: " + age);
console.log("Salary: " + salary);
console.log("Grade: " + grade);
console.log("Is Student: " + isStudent);
```

## For loop example
```javascript showLineNumbers
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
    process.stdout.write(i + " ");
}
console.log();
